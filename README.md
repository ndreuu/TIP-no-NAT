# TIP benchmarks in HORN(ADT(LIA)) format

Benchmarks for competing CHC solvers on [CHC-COMP](https://chc-comp.github.io/) competition.

Adapted from pure ADT benchmarks taken from [``Tons of Inductive Problems''](https://github.com/tip-org/benchmarks).

Clauses are generally **not** linear.

[`adt_lia`](adt_lia) contains CHC systems over `QF_DTLIA`
[`pure_adt`](pure_adt) contains **same** (at least, similar) CHC systems over `QF_DT`
