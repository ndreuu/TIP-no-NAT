# TIP benchmarks in HORN(ADT(LIA)) format

Benchmarks for competing CHC solvers on [CHC-COMP](https://chc-comp.github.io/) competition.

Each benchmark is a CHC system with constraints in QF_DTLIA. Clauses are generally not linear.

Adapted from pure ADT benchmarks taken from [``Tons of Inductive Problems''](https://github.com/tip-org/benchmarks).
